📊 ElevateLabs_Task3: SQL Query Practice EcommerceDB2

This project is part of ElevateLabs Task 3, focused on writing essential SQL SELECT queries to retrieve and filter data from a structured Ecommerce Database. The database was built and populated in Task 2. In this task, we query it using various conditions, ranges, sorting, and pattern matching.

🎯 Objective
Practice SELECT statements

Filter data using WHERE, BETWEEN, LIKE, and DISTINCT

Sort and limit results using ORDER BY and LIMIT

Test pattern matching using wildcards

🛠️ Tools

. MySQL Workbench

EcommerceDB2 (created in Task 2)

🗂️ Dataset Overview
Tables Queried:

. Customers

. Products

. Orders

. Order_Items

. Payments

📝 Observations & Suggestions
Note: Some queries reference columns not present in the schema (city, category). You may consider adding these in future updates to improve functionality.

. Queries demonstrate the use of:

. Filtering with LIKE, BETWEEN

. Sorting with ORDER BY

. Limiting results with LIMIT

. Removing duplicates using DISTINCT


✅ Outcome
 You now have a clear understanding of how to retrieve data using SQL.
